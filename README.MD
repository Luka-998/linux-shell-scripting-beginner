This repository is organized as follows:


* **`root`**: 
* **`└── bioinformatics/`**
* **`├── basic-learning/`**
* **`└── my_scripts/`**: Shows that `my_scripts` is the last subdirectory listed within `bioinformatics`.

### Bioinformatics folder will contain bioinformatics related tools used in the command line of the linux shell
- **basic-learning** is actually the junk folder where I test code and figuring it out
- __my_scripts__ - storage for my own scripts made by me for task automation.
