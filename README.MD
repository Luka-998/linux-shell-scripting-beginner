This repository serves as a personal learning log and workspace dedicated to mastering the Linux shell command line and its application within the field of bioinformatics. 
Starting from the ground zero, I aim to build a strong understanding through intensive self-paced learning. The end goal is to leverage this knowledge to develop relevant projects, potentially in conjunction with the results of my master's thesis. For more information please contact at jasovicluka1@gmail.com

This repository is organized as follows:


* **`root`**: 
* **`└── bioinformatics/`**
* **`├── basic-learning/`**
* **`└── my_scripts/`**

### Bioinformatics folder will contain bioinformatics related tools used in the CLI
- **basic-learning** is actually the junk folder where I test code and figuring it out
- __my_scripts__ - storage for my own scripts made by me for task automation.
